def simulate_road_img(config):
    """
    Main function of the simulator. Creates an artificial cartoon-like image and a corresponding
    point cloud of on-lane pixels.

    An image consists of several overlayed layers, each one of them having a particular shape
    and beeing able to render itself with a configured color function (see colors.py). The
    configuration of the various layers (e.g. background layer, road layer) and their composition
    is completely up to the user. A example configuration is provided in config.py.

    In order to introduce sufficient variance for the neural net to learn in a meaningful manner,
    there exist 'filters' (see filters.py) that vary the layer configuration in a pseudo-random
    fashion. They tilt, for example, the road or shift it randomly. An example configuration of
    such filters can also be found in config.py.

    Input:
    config     -- configuration of the image layers, see config.py for an example configuration

    Output:
    img        -- the artificial image
    detections -- a listing of on-lane pixels
